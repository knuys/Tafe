                    <h2>About Sorrento</h2>
                    <p>On the Mornington Peninsula (one hour from Melbourne) next door to Portsea.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Our apartment is a lazy 10-minute walk from the relaxed township of Sorrento that offers
                        restaurants, cafes, a chemist, a supermarket, a butcher and lots more. It is located in a quiet
                        avenue, just 4 houses from the beach. It is in easy walking distance of the ocean beaches and
                        surf.
                        Your private luxury apartment consists of a spacious living area with leather lounge suite
                        overlooking a sun drenched, tree-filled private garden.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        This is the perfect place for a home away from home.

                    <p>"So sorry we had to go home after only one night. We will definitely stay two nights next
                        time!"

                        "This apartment is close to everything. We didn't need the car as the walks were amazing."

                        <br>
                        "Your attention to detail made our stay so relaxed and comfortable. It was such a shame we
                        had
                        to drive back to our little flat, which is smaller than your apartment. We want to move in!"

                            think of anything better except that wonderful breakfast. That bacon is the best in
